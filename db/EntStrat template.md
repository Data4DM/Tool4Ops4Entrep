and provides a clear comparison between the Value Chain Strategy and the Architectural Strategy across the four key choice areas.

| Choices | Value Chain Strategy | Architectural Strategy |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Customer | DELIVER value for EXISTING users: Identify customers important to existing firms who can gain increased value from new technologies. | DELIVER value for NEW users: Understand how to match specific stakeholders together to create and deliver value for all sides. |
| Technology | Develop SPECIALIZED COMPONENT innovations: Focus on a single "horizontal" layer of the value chain where expertise and capabilities are unrivaled. | Develop GENERAL SYSTEM innovations: Develop either (1) a platform upon which others can build products or (2) a market intermediary. |
| Competition | Orientation towards COLLABORATION and Investment in EXECUTION: Integrate into the existing value chain to create new value for existing users. Execute quickly to bring the best solution for a segment through an existing value chain. | Orientation towards COMPETITION and Investment in CONTROL: Focus on architecting a new value chain that creates distinct value not currently provided in the economy. Leverage this value chain to compete. Control the unique, new value chain to ultimately lead and shape an emerging ecosystem. |
| RESOURCES & CAPABILITIES | Build FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES: Form tightly knit teams with unique capabilities. Ensure priority in negotiations with existing value chain players. | Leverage INTEGRATED RESOURCES: Monitor the needs of key stakeholders who create value and provide investments complementary to those of others. Work to ultimately position the venture as a market hub. |
